My friend and I always have a dream of doing this thing. But after our graduation we gradually become busy on other stuffs.

I decided to rebuild it using the latest technoligies in JavaScript / node.js and maybe Python, and SQL / NoSQL.

The repo here is part of the code, still under development. All rights reserved.
